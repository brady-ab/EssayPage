        <p>You may wonder if Esports will ever control a share in mainstream media that rivals regular sports. <br> I am convinced they will. Here's why: <br> <br>
         It's no secret that video games have risen in popularity since their inception, and will continue to do so. <br> 
         Because everyone owns a phone and a computer, the barrier to entry is lower than ever. <br>
         Additionally, people have never spent more time online than they do now, meaning they're more likely <br>  to be exposed to Esports. <br> 
         I think Esports' biggest threat is how fragmented and individual the competitive communities for each <br>  game are under the umbrella that is esports. <br>
         But this problem will also solve itself, as an esport only dies when people stop playing it, <br> and as established, people have never been flocking to esports more.</p>
