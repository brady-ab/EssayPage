     <h1>Technology bad?</h1>

        <p>
         When I was growing up, it seemed like the adults in my life were always anti-technology. This put me at odds with them, because I have always believed in it.
         There's that old meme that I can't seem to find the source of, it goes "Technology bad, fire scary, Thomas Edison was a witch." That's always the thought process I assigned
         those adults who didn't subscribe to the greatness of tech. <br> <br>

         As I've gotten older, it has become more and more tempting to think of it as scary, bad, or undecipherable. After all,
         there are Tiktokers who are able to market scams directly to children. Of course that's bad, and we as a society need to find a solution.<br><br>

         But Tiktok, or technology, can't be good or bad. I don't think they're capable of possessing these qualities. They are used by people with those intentions, 
         and that is what is important and must be regulated.
