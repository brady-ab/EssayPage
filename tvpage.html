        <p>Have you ever been a few seasons into a show you thought you really liked and thought "Wow, this show is terrible?" <br><br>
         
            I can't count the amount of shows that have an excellent few seasons and fulfill their vision,
            only to be artificially extended and become a hollow representation of what they were. But I can try.<br>
            And I can also try to figure out why. But honestly, it's probably just big studios doing what big studios do.
